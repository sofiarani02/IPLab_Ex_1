    <h4>City of Dragons is a 2011 fantasy novel by American writer Robin Hobb, 
        the third book in The Rain Wild Chronicles. City of Dragons is as enthralling an instalment 
        as any Robin Hobb has written. The gradual unfolding of the tale and the 
        progressive uncovering of the legend of the Elderlings is to be read and savoured. </h4>
